ABOUT KOLKATA

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</center>
<br>
KOLKATA is currently the third most populous metropolitan city in
India after Delhi and Mumbai.
During the British colonial era from 1700 to 1912 Kolkata was the
capital of British India. Kolkata witnessed a spate of frenzied
construction activity in the early 1850s by several British
companies. The construction was largely influenced by the conscious
intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, and Oriental
designs. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction
stresses minimalism, much of the layout of the architectural variety
in Kolkata owes its origins from European styles and tastes imported
mainly by the British, and lesser extent of the Portuguese and
French.
Today, many of these structures are in various stages of decay. Some
of the major buildings of this period are well maintained and
several buildings have been declared as heritage structures.
Conservation efforts are patchy and are often affected by problems
of litigation, tenant troubles, ownership disputes, old tenancy laws
and a lack of funds.
